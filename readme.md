# Creating a Shopping Cart using the ArrayList class

### The Item Class
Create an **Item** class that models an Item to be purchased. It should contain instance data and a constructor to hold the following characteristics: name, price and quantity. Item class should also include accessor methods for the 3 characteristics and a toString summary.

### The ShopApp Class
Create an `ArrayList` to hold `Item` instances. Call your `ArrayList` `items`. Here is an example of an `ArrayList` declaration that holds `String` instances:

```java
ArrayList<String> ingredients = new ArrayList<String>();
```

The `ShopApp` class should be designed to model shopping in similar fashion to Amazon and other online sites (where you can add to cart and you will see your total increase with each item added). Use a loop to simulate shopping, asking the user to enter the item, quantity and price. (You will need variables for these.) Store the items in an `ArrayList` and update the total due at checkout.

**Stretch task**: Provide an opportunity to remove an item from the shopping cart if a user no longer desires to make that particular purchase.

Examples
```
Enter the name of the item: Shoes
Enter the unit price: 25
Enter the quantity: 2

Current Cart
Item: Shoes		  Price: 25.0	    Quantity: 2
Total Price: $50.00

Continue shopping (y/n)? y
Enter the name of the item: Shirt
Enter the unit price: 15
Enter the quantity: 3

Current Cart
Item: Shoes		  Price: 25.0	    Quantity: 2		
Item: Shirt		  Price: 15.0	    Quantity: 3		
Total Price: $95.00

Continue shopping (y/n)? n
```

**Stretchier task**: Create a `Cart` class that is responsible for managing `items`. `ShopApp` should only manipulate the contents of the cart by calling methods on `Cart`. It should not talk directly to `Item` instances.
